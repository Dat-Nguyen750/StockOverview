# 502 Error Fixes for Stock Evaluation API

## Problem Description

You were experiencing 502 errors when trying to analyze stocks. These errors were coming from the Financial Modeling Prep API but weren't being properly handled and logged by your application.

## Root Cause

The 502 errors were occurring because:
1. The Financial Modeling Prep API was experiencing temporary issues (Bad Gateway)
2. Your application wasn't properly handling these specific HTTP status codes
3. Error messages weren't being logged with the correct format for tracking

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Data Fetcher (`modules/data_fetcher.py`)

- **Added specific handling for 502 and 503 errors** with retry logic
- **Improved logging** to track API response status codes
- **Better error messages** for different HTTP status codes
- **Exponential backoff** for retries on server errors
- **Connection and timeout error handling**

### 2. Improved API Error Handling in Main Server (`main.py`)

- **Specific HTTP status code handling** for 502, 503, 401, 429, 504 errors
- **Proper error logging** with the format you were seeing: `API_ERROR: IP - TICKER - API Error: 502`
- **Descriptive error messages** for users
- **Consistent error handling** across GET and POST endpoints

### 3. Enhanced Web App Error Handling (`web_app.py`)

- **Status code-specific error messages** for users
- **Better error logging** for debugging
- **Improved user experience** with clear error messages

### 4. Monitoring and Testing Tools

- **`test_502_handling.py`**: Test script to verify error handling
- **`monitor_502_errors.py`**: Real-time monitoring of 502 errors and other issues

## How to Use the Fixes

### 1. Restart Your Servers

After applying these changes, restart both servers:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the API server
python main.py

# Terminal 2: Start the web app
python web_app.py
```

### 2. Test the Error Handling

Use the test script to verify the fixes:

```bash
python test_502_handling.py
```

**Note**: Replace the placeholder API keys in the test script with your actual keys.

### 3. Monitor for 502 Errors

Use the monitoring script to track errors in real-time:

```bash
# Real-time monitoring
python monitor_502_errors.py

# Analyze recent errors
python monitor_502_errors.py analyze
```

## What You'll See Now

### Before the Fix
```
2025-06-28 17:23:24,726 - __main__ - ERROR - API_ERROR: 127.0.0.1 - AAPL - API Error: 502
```

### After the Fix
```
2025-06-28 17:23:24,726 - __main__ - ERROR - API_ERROR: 127.0.0.1 - AAPL - API Error: 502
2025-06-28 17:23:24,726 - __main__ - INFO - Bad Gateway (502) error from Financial Modeling Prep API on attempt 1/3
2025-06-28 17:23:24,726 - __main__ - INFO - Waiting 10 seconds before retry for 502 error
```

## Error Handling Improvements

### HTTP Status Code Handling

| Status Code | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 502 | Bad Gateway | Retry with 10s delay, then fail with clear message |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Retry with 15s delay, then fail with clear message |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Fail immediately with "Invalid API key" message |
| 429 | Rate Limited | Retry with exponential backoff |
| 504 | Gateway Timeout | Fail with timeout message |

### User-Friendly Error Messages

- **502**: "Financial Modeling Prep API is experiencing issues. Please try again later."
- **503**: "Financial Modeling Prep API is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."
- **401**: "Invalid API key for Financial Modeling Prep. Please check your API key."
- **429**: "API rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
- **504**: "Request timed out. Please try again later."

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Real-Time Monitoring

The `monitor_502_errors.py` script will show you:
- üö® 502 errors as they occur
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API errors
- üêå Rate limit issues
- üîå Connection problems
- ‚úÖ Successful evaluations

### Log Analysis

Check your logs for these patterns:
- `API_ERROR: IP - TICKER - API Error: 502`
- `Bad Gateway (502) error from Financial Modeling Prep API`
- `Financial Modeling Prep API is experiencing issues`

## Prevention Tips

1. **Monitor API Health**: Use the `/health` endpoint to check API status
2. **Check Rate Limits**: Use the `/rate-limits` endpoint to monitor usage
3. **Use Valid API Keys**: Ensure your Financial Modeling Prep API key is valid
4. **Implement Circuit Breaker**: Consider adding circuit breaker pattern for production

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** with the provided test script
2. **Monitor for 502 errors** using the monitoring script
3. **Check your API keys** are valid and have sufficient quota
4. **Consider upgrading** your Financial Modeling Prep plan if you're hitting rate limits frequently

## Support

If you continue to see 502 errors after these fixes:

1. Check the Financial Modeling Prep API status page
2. Verify your API key has sufficient quota
3. Monitor the logs for specific error patterns
4. Consider implementing additional retry logic or fallback data sources
